### First Intelligent Prometheus or short FIP
FIP is an open source project to create a machine learning robot that can move and complete simple tasks.
I strongly believe robotization is our path to a better and sustainable future for humankind.
To get to that point we don't need just machines that can complete our tasks, but that can also think their own way. 


## What should be FIP?
Right now FIP doesn't exist, but it should be a bunch of servo motors with at his earth, an old android phone. Since creating an OS is a very complicated thing and we want to concentrate on the interesting part, we'll focus on creating an app that can give the output to the motors to make them move and read their data, with the data of the phone itself (GPS, accelerometer), process it with a machine learning algo.
With a sim card in the phone we'll be able to connect it to the internet and command it remotely.
## Why Open Source?
I do believe in the power of community and it has no sense to close knowledge to the rest of the world. Community and opening knowledge is what brought us on top of this daily technological discovery. Prometheus is the titan who brought the knowledge of fire to the humans, at the cost of his eternal punishment. Homo Sapiens is on top of the food chain because of that. That's why we want you to help, not just me, nor this project but the whole humankind. And the end let's be honest, there are already barriers to create your own FIP (deep technical knowledge required, money and others). 
## What will be next? 
Firstly and clearly we have to get FIP done, but the plan would be then to modify the app to support being part of a blockchain where the FIPs support each other by connecting data via bluetooth and the biggest and more powerful phones could in a decentralized way develop stronger algorythms which would be always through bluetooth passed to the older or weaker FIPs.
